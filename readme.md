# Prebuilt static binaries for ffmpeg, ffprobe, ffserver and ffplay

Used by API at [ffbinaries.com](http://ffbinaries.com) ([git repo](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-api)).

There's also a [CLI downloader in Node.js available on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ffbinaries) ([git-repo](https://github.com/vot/ffbinaries-node)) to allow easier implementation in build scripts.
